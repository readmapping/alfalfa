##ALFALFA summary of alignment accuracy
##
##Warning: these results only make sense if the query file is sorted according to query name.
##
##SAM file containing alignments: 454reads.sam
##Results will be presented for all alignments in the file, unique alignments and for the         fraction of reads for which the mapping quality is at least: 
##For every category, the fraction of alignments/reads mapped (and paired correctly) will be shown.
##Furthermore, a list is given of number of alignments per read.
