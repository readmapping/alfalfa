##ALFALFA check alignment accuracy using an oracle file for simulated reads
##
##Warning, these results only make sense if the SAM file is sorted according to         query name and if the edit distance field is filled correctly.
##
##SAM file containing alignments: paired_end_local.sam
##
##An alignment is considered correct if it falls within a certain range from the simulated origin
##The ranges that are considered are: 50
##
##Results will be presented for all alignments in the file, unique alignments and for the         fraction of reads for which the mapping quality is at least: 
##
##The first 6 columns represent number and percentage of alignments that are correct, ok         (not close to origin/not paired correctly, but with a smaller or equal edit distance) and incorrect alignments.
##The second 6 columns represent these numbers and percentages for the reads. A read is considered correctly mapped        if at least one correct alignment has been found (and likewise for ok reads).
##
##
##Results
##
##Number of reads: 50
##Reads are paired?: true
